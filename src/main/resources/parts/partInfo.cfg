Probe Core:
	The heart of any spacecraft. The core provides control authority for the craft, so every craft NEEDS at least one.

Engine:
	Power! Provides thrust through combustion of fuel. Also generates a small amount of electricity. Must be placed directly underneath a fuel tank. Do not place yourself directly underneath an engine.

Fuel Tank:
	Juice for the machine. Stores hydrogen and oxygen - which are used to power an engine or generator. Warranty void if exposed to hydrogen or oxygen.

Laser:
	A multipurpose death ray. High-power laser than can be used to mine for resources or attack other spacecraft. Do not look directly int-ahhhhh my eyes! It burns!

Radar:
	Eyeball-extenders. Uses radio waves to detect foreign objects. Do not ask it any deep questions, for it can also see into your soul.

Antenna:
	The "social communicatron" allows you to communicate with other spacecraft. To send a message to spacecraft near you, use the "chat" bind.

Battery:
	Stores electric power for later use. Automatically charged by engines or generators. Definitely not a pack of D-cell batteries taped together.

Generator:
	A fancy engine without any thrust. Consumes fuel to produce an amazing amount of electricity. Now I wonder what will happen if I stick a fork in it...

Structural Node:
	The most flexible (but rigid?) spacecraft part out there. This can be placed onto any part. Super useful and light way for attatching extra parts. Also useful as a stool.
