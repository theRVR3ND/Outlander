# Kilo Engine

The Kilo Engine is a Java-based networked game engine. It was made for students to explore networking with Java, as well as making a custom game. The code is designed to be *mostly* understandable, hence the copious commenting. The engine uses some cool concepts, such as delta encoding and Run Length Encoding. Overall file and networking structure inspired by the Quake 3 engine. Several resources come with source code, in an attempt to help in deciphering the code.

Anyone is welcome to wade into the craphole of code and take a shot a modding it. Good luck and have fun!

### Getting Started

How to install and run the engine.

#### Prerequisites

While the project was built for wide access, there are some difficult concepts in the code. Students in AP Computer Science or above should be able to understand the code. Nevertheless, anyone is welcome to explore.

#### Installing

1. Download the code (skip if already downloaded).

```
Go to github.com/theRVR3ND. In "Repositories," search for "Kilo-Engine." Click "Clone or download" and "Download ZIP."
```

2. Unzipping

```
In file explorer, right-click downloaded .zip file and click "Extract Here."
```

3. Running

```
There are two options for running the engine. One is through your favorite IDE (JGrasp FTW). Simply go to "Kilo-Engine -> src -> main -> java" and open up cg_Client.java. Run and enjoy. The other way of running is with the provided batch file, in the "Kilo-Engine" folder, called "Kilo-Engine.bat." Just double click that and run. Using the first option is probably better though.
```

### Javadocs

Besides in-code comments reflecting my declining mental state as I wrote the program, there are Java Documentation comments for a more organized view of methods and values. To generate Javadocs in JGrasp, click the book icon in the top toolbar. And wait.

### Futher Information

For information on modding (and just understanding) the Kilo Engine, refer to "KiloEngineGuide.txt" in "Kilo-Engine -> src -> guide."
